The response we got was a huge surprise. We realized then and there that Cobalt was not just a single-player game, and thus the great journey began. We added more modes (Team-Strike, Capture the Plug. Bounty, Survival) and released an Alpha.<br><br>From huge community demand, we then tried but failed at adding network support. These were trying times which left us wondering what to do next. We decided to focus our efforts single-player, the single-player you just played!<br><br>Finally, through nothing but the relentless efforts of Mojang, Fatshark jumped on the task of porting Cobalt to consoles, including adding network support! So in the end, even though it always felt like one thing would have to be scrapped, we ended up with both the single-player, the local versus, and the network support.<br><br>Thank you for playing, and thank you for supporting us throughout our journey.",

What can I say? They're friendly, but they're certainly not the brightest stars in the galaxy.<tag><tag><tag=encounter_trappers><br>Apperently The Trappers are a gang of Felishroom bounty hunters and slave traders.

TG could probably help out a bunch more if he didn't insist on popping in and out on a whim.<br>The Deathshrooms have a thing for looting, pillaging, and apparently digging as well. What is it with mushroom people and living underground...<br>Lucky for me they dug up lots of goodies; an alien artifact, the remnants of Borealis base 'Centurion', and gold! Could there be another cipher located here? Hopefully.

I'm pretty sure I gave them at least 3 seconds to surrender. <tag<tag=deathshrooms_try_breaking_into_base><br>Conveniently, they were spread evenly throughout the mine. They were probably too focused on digging for gold. And then I came - surprise! They had a bunch of tools and melee weapons, which came in handy, literally (ILTDPOARP get it? Do my puns pleasure your hunk of junk? Can you even laugh?).<br>Anyway, deep inside the mine I encountered the Centurion, a major breakthrough! I gathered from eavesdropping on a pair of Deathshrooms, that they have some sort of collaboration with the robots. It also seems like the robots tried to keep them locked outside the base. Their alliance is fragile.<br>I witnessed one of the shrooms running through radioactive gas(without the fans on) like it was nothing. It did not end well.<br><tag><encountered_leader_georgie><br>By the time I caught up with the Deathshroom leader he had already gotten word of my intrusion and sent his best man, Brutus, to deal with me.<br><killed_brutus> I had no choice but to elimnate the poor guy, which put the remaining Deathshrooms in full panic mode.<tag><tag=leader_dead><br>They started rushing me from all places, that didn't go too well either.

I did my business and ran out chanting 'location,location,location'.<br>The shopkeep must have been thrilled to see another living soul.<br><tag> <tag=found_relay>Finally I found the relay station. This time in the midst of what appeared to be some twisted artsy kind of architecture, or perhaps a remnant from some other civilization - alien both to us humans and to Trunkopia. The plot thickens!<br>As I approached the station robots teleported in from a dropship. This goes to show that they have some sort of organized community that is able to operate and maintain this machinery year after year. What sets off the defences everytime I start tinkering with the relays? Is It an alarm of some sort, or is someone or something trying to stop me from reaching the cipher?<br>The voice eminating from the relay computers hints at the latter.<tag=destroyed_relay><br>It was a good fight, and a close call, but I eventually got the cipher.
